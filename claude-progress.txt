## Session 1 - 2026-02-07

### Completed Features
- Feature #1: Server boots and env vars loaded ✅
  - Updated middleware to whitelist /api/health endpoint for infrastructure checks
  - Health endpoint confirms all 4 env vars loaded and file system access verified
  - Created .env.local with test credentials

- Feature #2: Auth middleware active on all protected routes ✅
  - Verified unauthenticated GET to / → 307 redirect to /login
  - Verified unauthenticated GET to /gallery → 307 redirect to /login
  - Verified unauthenticated GET to /api/events → 401 Unauthorized
  - Verified GET to /login without auth → 200 OK
  - No code changes needed - middleware was already correct from scaffolding

- Feature #3: File system access to oulipo repo verified ✅
  - Health endpoint confirms: oulipoRepo, eventsJson, upcomingHtml, cvHtml all true
  - GET /api/events successfully reads 11 real events from events.json
  - POST /api/events successfully writes and persists data across server restart
  - Test data written, verified persistence, then cleaned up
  - No mock data patterns found in codebase

### Current Status
- 3/95 features passing (3.2%)
- Server running on http://localhost:3000
- All infrastructure features assigned to this batch are complete

### Code Changes
- middleware.ts: Added /api/health to auth whitelist
- .env.local: Created with test credentials (gitignored)

### Notes
- Font loading errors from type.cargo.site are expected (external fonts, not app errors)
- Next.js dev server occasionally returns 404 for API routes during hot-reload; restart fixes it
- The oulipo repo at /Users/halim/Documents/oulipo/ has real event data (11 events)
