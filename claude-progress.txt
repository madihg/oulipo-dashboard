  - GET /api/calendar/deadlines → 401 Unauthorized
  - All verified via both curl and Playwright browser
  - No code changes needed - middleware already handles this

- Feature #62: Focus management on navigation ✅
  - Focus moves to main content area when clicking nav links (handleNavClick + tabIndex={-1})
  - Skip to content link works (visible on Tab, links to #main-content)
  - No focus trap - Tab moves freely between content and navigation
  - Focus-visible outlines on all interactive elements (buttons, links, nav items)
  - Shift+Tab returns from navigation to skip-to-content link
  - Implementation already done by parallel agent session

- Feature #55: Desktop layout with side panel on right ✅
  - 1920px viewport: content on left (1668px), nav panel on right (220px)
  - Grid layout: 1fr auto with 2rem gap
  - Navigation panel: position sticky, top 0, full viewport height
  - No horizontal scrollbar (scrollWidth === clientWidth === 1920)
  - No code changes needed - layout was already correct
